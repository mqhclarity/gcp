# Learn Terraform - Provision a GKE Cluster

This is me trying to make a Harness.io . [Harness.io](https://harness.io) 

First, I create a kubernetes cluster with GKE using terraform apply.

```
terraform init
terraform apply
``` 

The cluster is made in a free tier google account. It's kinda small. Potentially too small for the harness agent to come up.
